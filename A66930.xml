            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr you were theſe diſcourſes firſt deſigned, and into your hands are they now put, with an hearty looking up to Heaven for a Bleſſing upon them; that neither I may write, nor ye read in vain. My circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are known to many of you; and ſeeing I cannot be as Generally and Publickly uſeful to you as I would, I was willing to be as ſerviceable to you as I can. 'Tis now ſome years ſince in diſcourſe with a Friend of mine, who hath often been Sub-S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>riff of your County, I was told how many Thouſand Sheep were found by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in your County: So that the Inhabitants of other Counties in this Kingdom did not ſtick to ſay, that your Sheep did eat up, not only your Graſs only, but your People too: It is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:34195:3"/> thinly planted, in compariſon of ſome other Parts of the Kingdom. This put me upon thoughts how I might direct you to the Improvement of your Flocks to higher advantage than ſome others. Eſpecially the Providence of God caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my lot to ſpeak in a Countrey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, to moſt who are ſome way or other concern'd with that ſort of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: And not having found among the many Booke made publick, any thing of this Theme; I hoped it might be ſome way uſeful to ſtir you up in your management of your ſtock, to raiſe your hearts higher than their Wool, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been but a little while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this courſe of life, and therefore if thoſe of you, that are better skill'd herein, find any miſtakes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in what is offered, beſides the common Apology of Humane Error, I have to plead a failure of judgement in the matter, not of Affection to you: Tho
<pb facs="tcp:34195:3"/> I have been wanting neither in an endeavour inform my judgement the beſt way I could.</p>
            <p>One thing I foreſee the Obſervant Reader will find deficient, <hi>viz.</hi> That no place is here allotted to the Follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, or Under-Shepherds to Chriſt: Such both Magiſtrates and Miniſters hear in Sacred Writ. But I have this to anſwer to it; None ſuch heard me when I diſcours'd theſe things, nor do I know whether any ſuch will deign the reading them: And to others it would be vain to blot Paper to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. We have but too many who carp at Magiſtrates and Miniſters for the neglect of their Duties, who would better place their time in amending their own.</p>
            <p>I have purpoſely waved matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial, wherein I find the Genius of this Age to over-bound. 'Tis practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Holineſs will be the beſt Evidence to our ſelves and others, that we are
<pb facs="tcp:34195:4"/> indeed the Sheep of the Holy Jeſus. And what ever apprehenſions ſome, that are ſtrangers to me, may have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd, I can in the words of Truth and Soberneſs ſay, I had much rather be uſeful to bring one poor Lamb into the Fold of the Bleſſed Jeſus, than Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte ten to any opinion wherein I differ from others.</p>
            <p>God hath bleſt ſome of you, My Friends, with large Flocks: I beg they may all bear Golden Fleeces to you, when you ſhall be much enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them Godward. That we may ſay concerning you in our requeſts for you, what the Beloved Diſciple pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved <hi>Gaius, 3 John 2. ver. That ye may proſper and be in health, even as your Souls proſper.</hi> If this Eſſay (mean as it is, for ſuch it was deſign'd for the general uſe) by the Bleſſing of Heaven may in any meaſure promote this your Proſperity, it will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compenſate this Labour of</p>

                  <p>ANd is not the way of Holineſs, of pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of heedful and holy walking, an ancient and an Honourable way? Have not the People of God in all ages been found walking in thoſe paths? We find now indeed purity and ſtrict converſation reproached as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; a Vizard which Satan in theſe laſt and worſt daies hath put on real Godlineſs, to ſcare men off from it. But whoſo will conſiderately enquire ſhall find Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an ancient path. Though every antient way be not good. Sin and errour were early in the world; yet the way of Truth and purity will be found the moſt antient way. The good way is the old way, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16. Antiquity diſjoyned from verity is but filthy hoarineſs: (remember the <hi>Gibeonites, Ios.</hi> 9. 12, 13, 14.) and deſerveth no more reverence than an old Fornicator, who is ſo much the more odious becauſe old; yet we

                  <p>Firſt, it was the way in which the Saints of the moſt High in all ages have walked, who have thence their Name, from their holy hearts and walks. This <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> hints to <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 5. 1. and hence to us they are called a cloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. becauſe of a directive or leading virtue in them, in alluſion to the Cloud that load the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs. What the Scripture ſpeaks of each of theſe, ye know: briefly to hint one or two, <hi>David</hi> was a man after God's own heart (ſuch a one as he deſired, and therefore was his <hi>Corcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum)</hi> and did fulfill all his Wills, <hi>Act.</hi> 13, 22. from 1 <hi>Sam. 13. 14.

So <hi>Enoch Gen.</hi> 5. 22, 24. walked with God, <hi>i. e.</hi> holily; they that walk otherwiſe, walk with the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was the way of Man before Sin: The conſtitution of man in his Creation, was that he ſhould walk holilywith his God. God made man upright, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. in the image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. which conſiſted in Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, <hi>Col. 3. 10.

                  <p>Thirdly, It was and is the way of the bleſſed Angels, who were made before man, and whoſe Relation as Creatures keeps them in obedience to their Maker. Hence they are ſaid <hi>to do his Commandments, hearkning to the voice of his word.</hi> Pſal. 103. 20. The wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſinning, is called the leaving their firſt eſtate, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. with <hi>Iude 4. i. e.</hi> their original integrity and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Lord and Maker in all things. The good Angels dothe will of God readily, chearfully, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally, and with delight, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
                  <p>Yea Fourthly, ſo ancient as the way of God himſelf. God is called <hi>the Ancient of days,</hi> Dan. 7. 9, 13, 23. <hi>i. e.</hi> he that was before daies, or time or any other Creature: ſo the Pſalmiſt excellently expounds it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 2. God's Eternity and wiſdom is ſet out by that Name <hi>Ancient of dayes:</hi> and what is his way? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, <hi>Pſal. 145. 17. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi> Not only are all the ways wherein the Lord walks, righteous; and the works he doth, holy: but he can go in no way, but a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous way, nor do any work, but a work of Holineſs. Hence Holineſs is called the Life of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. becauſeit is from God, as the Author; unto God, as the End; and according to God, as the pattern. And ſhall we need go any higher to prove the holy way the old way, than to ſay, it is the way of the Eternal God? And for the Honour of it, the ſame hints may ſuffice. Let it not therefore move any that a Vizard of novelty is put upon an aged Face to make a ſcare-Crow to frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten weaker Judgments from cloſing with truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The beſt of men from the firſt of time have walked thus.</p>

                     </gap>, a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, and may better than the City of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> take for her <hi>poſie, Immota manet.</hi> The Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, although they have been the hate of Enemies of all Ages, yet have been a Mountain impregnable, all force and fury hath not been able to prevail againſt them. The invincible perennity and continuance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, maugre the injury and iniquity of times and Tyrants who have ſought to ſuppreſs them, is a good argument to prove them Divinity <hi>Antiochus</hi> the vile, <hi>Diccleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian</hi> cauſed all the Books of the Sacred Scriptures that could be found to be burnt: The Papiſts oft ſince in <hi>France, Bohemia,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſtill they remain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scriptures afford feeding free from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and annoiance: they call men off from the cumbers and encumbrances of the world, to refreſh themſelves with and in the Lord. Worldly cares, as Thorns, choak the Word and make it unfruitful and unſuccesful. Hence thoſe hints in the ſacred Oracles, of laying aſide all hinderances for communion with God in his Ordinances and Appointments. <hi>Abraham</hi> leaves the Servants and Aſſes at the Foot of the Hill, <hi>Gen. 22. 5. Iacob</hi> ſent his Wives Children and all that he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Iabbok,</hi> e're he wreſtled with the Lord, <hi>Gen. 32. 23. Moſes</hi> comes alone to God, and leaves the Flocks, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 3. The Church gets her into the clefts of the Rock, <hi>Cant. 2. 14. Iſaac</hi> into the Field, <hi>Daniel</hi> to the River's ſide, Chriſt into the Mount, <hi>Peter</hi> up to the Leads or houſe-top, that they might pour their prayers, and ſolace themſelves with God in ſecret. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Duties, eſpecially of Prayer and Meditation, is the bread eaten in ſecret which is ſweet and fattening, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are pure and dry feeding: free from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34195:18"/> Mire and Water of Mens inventions, whereby they are ſoiled. God complains of thoſe that had trod his Sheep's leas, <hi>Ezek</hi> 34. 18. On which Text he was not far out of the way, who ſaid, here we have a lively Picture of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy, who eat up the beſt, and tread down the reſt; ſo that the poor miſſed and muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led People are glad to eat ſuch as they can catch: they are fed with traditions, legendary Fables, indulgences, vowed pilgrimages, penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had not <hi>Luther</hi> come in our way, ſay they, we could have perſwaded the People to have eaten graſs. What cauſe have we to bleſs God, that it is better with us? We run to the Law and to the Teſtimony, where we have the pure word of God, which is clean and cleanſing feeding.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, 'tis ſweet: ſo ſweet that <hi>David</hi> knows not how to expreſs it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and 119. Philoſophy ſays, <hi>de guiſtibus non diſputandum,</hi> Men muſt not diſpute of Taſts. Divinity ſhews that God's feeding is pleaſant beyond expreſſion. 'Tis ever ſpringing and freſh bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Though it boaſt not in effeminate Phraſes, yet is it full of Maſculine eloquence, and of ſuch ſoul-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſweetneſs that many have found ſtrange ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by one word applied to, and ſet home upon the heart. It is ever freſh-ſpringing; Though many in all Ages of the Chriſtian Church have ſpent time and pains in opening the excellency of thoſe ſacred Oracles, yet ſtill is there room enough for all ſucceeding ages. Yet attentively and diligently is it ſeldome read, but it affords continually new matter of admiration.</p>

                     <hi>Thomas Tomkins</hi> had his hand by <hi>Bonner</hi> held directly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the flame of a wax Taper, till the Veins ſhrunk, and the Sinews burſt, and the water out of them ſpurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Harpsfields</hi> Face, as he ſtood by; yet <hi>Tomkins</hi> affirmed afterward to ſome Friends, that during this cruel burning his Spirit was ſo rapt, that he felt no pain. The like did <hi>Edmund Tyrell</hi> to a Daughter of Father <hi>Munts,</hi> holding the Candle croſs-wiſe under the back of her hand, continuing it ſo long, till her Sinews crackt aſunder, he ſtill ſaying, why Whore, wilt thou not cry? The ſaid Maid told a Friend, that at firſt ſhe felt ſome pain, but afterward little or nothing at all. <hi>James Bainham</hi> at the ſtake, in the midſt of the burning Fire, his Legs and Arms being half conſumed, ſaid, Ye look for miracles, lo, here ye may ſee one; for in this Fire I feel no more pain, than if I were in a bed of down, and it is to me as a bed of Roſes. <hi>Henry Voes,</hi> and <hi>John Eſch,</hi> when they came to be burnt for the Truth of the Goſpel, joyfully embraced the ſtake, continuing ſinging Pſalms, and when the Fire was kindled at their feet, one of them ſaid, Methinks you do ſtrew Roſes under my feet.</p>

Blood is found the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching dreſſing for the truth of God, the Blood of the Martyr the ſeed of the Church. Perſecution at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and taking off <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſpread the Diſciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad preaching the Goſpel. <hi>Act. 8. 1. Dorothous</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, there were 2000 other believers put to death the ſame day. And our Martyrologiſt acquaints us, that after Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> had broke the Ice under Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> there ſuffered in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, one Arch-Biſhop, 4 Biſhops, 21 Divines, 8 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, 84 Artificers, 100 Husbandmen, Servants and Labourers, 26 Wives, 20 Widows, 9 Virgins,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34195:26"/> 2 Boys, and two Infants, in all 277; ſome ſay a great many more. Yea though though Truth be ſuppreſt in one place, it breaks out in another, to the Churches great advantage: which, like the Sea, what ground it loſeth in one part, it getteth in another. Thus at <hi>Melda</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (Ten Miles from <hi>Paris)</hi> the Biſhop thereof deſirous of a Reformation, put away the Monks, and called in the help of divers Godly Miniſters; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted by the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> ſoon fell off from the profeſſion of the Truth: and thoſe good Miniſters <hi>(Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Farrel, Ruffus</hi> and others) were driven into divers other places of <hi>France,</hi> where they planted ſeveral Churches, the deſtruction of one being the edification of many. <hi>Trucidabantur &amp; multiplicabantur.</hi> Aug. <hi>Plures efficimur quoties metimur.</hi> Tertul. <hi>Eccleſia totum mundum ſanguine &amp; oratione convertit.

The Gates &amp;c.</hi> that is, the power and policy, the craft and cruelty of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Inſtruments ſhall not prevail to her utter ruine: if they lop the branches in one place, they ſhall break forth in another.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, by all God both purgeth out the Corruptions, and exerciſeth the Graces of his People. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. by this, <hi>i. e.</hi> by their being carried Captive to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> As one Poyſon is antidotary to another, ſo is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to ſin. Croſſes are Leeches to ſuck the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, flails to threſh off their husks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are files too, to brighten their Graces. When there was a conſulation held at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether <hi>Carthage</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed or no, <hi>Scipio</hi> perſwaded the <hi>Senatours</hi> to let it ſtand, leſt the People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould want an occaſion or object whereon to exerciſe their valour. So God could ſoon deſtory all the perſecuting enemies of his Church: But he rather ſuffers them to live, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34195:26"/> they may be for the Exerciſe of his Peoples Wiſdom, Faith, Zeal, Conſtancy, Courage, Patience, and the whole panoply of Grace in them. The Chriſtians had enjoyed much reſt and peace for many years, after the Perſecution of <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> with which reſt and tranquillity the Diſcipline of the Church came to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and fervent Devotion began to wax cold, much envy and contention riſing up between the Biſhops and Paſtors; for which cauſe God did juſtly ſuffer the Perſecution under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> in which the patience and conſtancy of the perſecuted was wonderful. In the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> the Biſhops, <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> could not agree about ſome ſmall matters of forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s daies, they were clapt up together, they could better accord. Chriſtians loſe nothing by their perſecutions, but their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>David</hi> found it good for him, that he had been afflicted, to bring him in from his ſtray-going, that he might keep more cloſely to, and walk more cloſely with, his God. The Church hath found her bitter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes uſeful to purge her. Chriſt being a ſign ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, diſcovers the thoughts of many hearts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 35. as they are alſo now in theſe diſcriminating ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times.

The blood of Chriſt, or the Spirit of God, (whichſoever be the Antitype to the water in Baptiſm, the latter probably) doth remove that ſcorching heat of the Lords indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives the Soul to lift up the head.

And though this be not ſo much in uſe among us, to walk before our Sheep, yet I conceive a cuſtom among us to allude hither, the under Shepherd ye uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call a <hi>Follower,</hi> which implies that the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd ſhould be a <hi>Leader.</hi>

                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the Great and good Shepherd in this regard alſo, he both leadeth and bringeth up his.

The waies of ſin are craggy, crooked, full of errour and terrour, leading to thoſe precipices that tend to deſtruction; from ſuch ſtand off, ſaith Chriſt to his Sheep, who all are rational, and will be ruled by him, <hi>Jo. 10. He goeth before his in every good way.</hi> It is ſtoried of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he was not wont to ſay to his Souldiers <hi>ite,</hi> but <hi>venite,</hi> Chriſt calls his unto thoſe paths in which himſelf hath walked, doth walk. In practice of holineſs he goeth before his, is an example and a pattern to them. Thus he became ſubject to his Parents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 51. being an example of family ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and it's very probable of induſtry and pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking too in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s calling, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 3. neither <hi>Adam,</hi> the Son of God by creation, even in innocency, was to lead an idle and unprofitable Life, but was to keep the Garden and to dreſs it; Nor Jeſus the Son of God by eternal generation, walk up and down unprofitably, but untill the Age of 30. when acording to the cuſtom of that People, he was to enter upon his publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he lived and wrought with his reputed Father. Thus his whole imploiment whilſt here among men, was to do good, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. ſo that even malice it ſelf, when challenged, could urge nothing unrighteous or irregular againſt him. <hi>Jo. 8. 46.

For ſeeing the touch of an unclean unclean Perſon rendred another unclean, as long as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was unclean, the Child muſt be accounted ſo too, which lay in her boſom, and ſuckt her Milk. And <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. 6. it appears that the time of purification had reſpect to the Infant, and was ſhorter or longer, as the child was either Male or Female. Our Saviour therefore being made under the Law, and ſubject to it, was until the fortieth day eſteemed unclean, until a Sacrifice offered. Wonderful condeſcention! ſo his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Feaſt of the Paſſover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned plainly: Thus to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Us Chriſtians alſo he lead in the way in which he would have us attend upon him. 'Tis not unobſervable that at 12 years of Age we find him among the Doctors, hearing them, and asking them queſtions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 46. to teach his to wait at Wiſdoms poſts, and not to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, to attend and to learn of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles.

Our preſent work is to conſider the care which every faithful Shepherd hath of the weak and diſtemper'd Sheep; not to let them lye in the ditch and periſh: but to ſtudy the diſtemper, and a ſuitable remedy, and make ſpeedy and careful application of it. They that are healthy and ſtrong can better ſhift, than they that are weak and infirm, and therefore the greater care is expected of ſuch, that they faint not, droop not, dye not. The neglect of this care 'tis that God reproves his naughty Shepherds for, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4. where the omiſſion of their care is noted by their neglect toward thoſe that were not in a good condition, for if theſe be neglected how are the reſt cared for? He reckons up alſo five diſtinct male-affections wherewith he mentions the Sheep to be troubled: diſeaſed, ſick, broken, driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, loſt, under which all other like troubles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended It's not much worth our time to enquire what may be the difference between one and the other of theſe: probably he calls thoſe diſeaſed, whoſe pain or grief lay in one member or limb: and thoſe ſick, whoſe whole body was diſtemper'd and diſeaſed: that which was broken intends either wounds received from ſome beaſt of prey, or caſual ſlip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that which was driven away is that which was puſht, or had fallen into ſome ditch, hole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſpeaks how much it is the duty of Shepherds to have regard to, and care of ſuch
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34195:39"/> as are thus diſtreſſed. Ye have ſomewhat a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the like falſhood, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 16. where the Prophet hints that the broken and diſeaſed have as much need of cure, as thoſe that are ſtrong and well of care for food. There are in a Flock the hidden or cut off, loſt and gone out of the way, whom it is a fault not to viſit and ſeek out: there are young ones more apt to wander than others, whom it is the Shepherds duty in a ſpecial way to ſeek, and have an eye to: There are the broken with afflictions or any Caſualties, who are to be healed, not cruſhed; and there are that ſtand ſtill for weakneſs, not being able to go on, and theſe are to be fed, and born (as the word is) with tenderneſs and compaſſion, if need be. The good Shepherd therefore <hi>in perâ geſtat unguentum,</hi> hath his Medicine ready in his ſcrip to apply as need requires: he not only not breaks the ſound, but alſo he binds up the broken. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this care <hi>Virgil</hi> reproves <note n="k" place="bottom">

                  <p>Herein alſo Jeſus Chriſt manifeſts himſelf the great and good Shepherd, according to the word of promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 16. however others neglect or ſlubber over their work, he will do it carefully, faithfully, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.

                  <p>Firſt, he ſeeks that which was loſt, loſt with an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction as to it ſelf. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word * ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a total ruine, ſuch as reduceth a thing to not being,

Chriſt came from Heaven to Earth, from the glory of the Father, to the form of a Servant, and being among men, he went up and down to ſeek and ſave Him that knoweth himſelf not a wandring Sheep only, but quite loſt, even in the Lions paw, his jaws, ready to be devoured, ſuch doth Chriſt take upon his neck, and like a good Shepherd bring home. Thus hath he dealt by all that have been brought to life by him, he hath ſnatcht them out of the mouth of the Lion and Bear, as <hi>David</hi> did the Lamb; <hi>ſnatch them out of the power of darkneſs, Col. 1. 13. He turns them ſrom</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, He brings again that which was driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, puſht away with force, (or as ſome render the word) thruſt into a ditch or pit. Sheep wandring from the Flock and the Shepherds eye, are apt to fall into holes, where they will periſh, if not found, taken out, and brought back. Whether we underſtand it of ſuch as are fallen into ſome ditch of ſin, or wandring from the way of truth and holineſs, it comes to neer one ſenſe. Such Chriſt takes out and brings home. He had given a law for this to the <hi>Jews, Ex. 23. 4. Deut. 22. 1.</hi> that they might learn pity to beaſts, much more to men, which therefore himſelf extends chiefly to their Souls; and juſtifieth his doing good to the body of a man on the ſabbath day, by this acknowledged practice of their own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 11. Thus he brought again <hi>David</hi> after many ſlips and that ſhameful fall in the matter of <hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34195:41"/> 
                     <hi>Janſenius</hi> notes) that our Saviour after his reſurrection, for the comfort of true Penitents, appeared firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> (not to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as Papiſts ſay) and <hi>Peter</hi> who had been grievous ſinners; yea, we may put in all his diſciples into this number of wandring Sheep brought home, who ſo ſhamefully had forſaken him, and yet he return'd them to his Fold: and the many revolters and wanderers whom he every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to himſelf, healing their backſliding becauſe he loves them freely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he binds up that which is broken, broken and even ſhivered to pieces, with the ſenſe of Sin, and fear of wrath: ſo broken, as if all their bones were rattling in their skin. This was <hi>David</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. by mentioning bones he notes the great grief of his mind for fear of the wrath of God, that it went even to his bones, [Which thou haſt broken] <hi>viz.</hi> with fear of thy vengeance: It hints moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pain, like him whoſe bones are broken, ye have ſomething like from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 3. by leaping over the pale of Gods Commands, he had broken his bones, and they pained him ſorely, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his great Sin he had wounded his Soul, which wrought him no ſmall diſquiet. Now the great Shepherd binds up theſe broken bones. For this was he anointed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. All three offices of Chriſt are by ſome found hinted in that verſe: <hi>He preacheth glad tidings,</hi> as a Prophet; <hi>bindeth up the broken-hearted,</hi> as a Prieſt; <hi>openeth the Priſon-door to thoſe that are bound,</hi> as a King. We may put them together, as good Chirurgions bind up wounds with ſwaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo Chriſt allays the grief of his people, for God's wrath provoked by their ſin, with the tenders of his grace. He hath <hi>manum medicam:</hi> He is the true <hi>Samaritan, Luk. 10. 33, 34. not the Phyſician only, (Exod.</hi> 15. 26.) but the Chirurgion alſo of his People.

He hath ſplinters for brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Leggs, and Cataplaſms for green wounds: Wine and Oyl to pour in, to cleanſe and heal the Wounds of Sin-ſick-ſouls. He that hath adviſed his ſpiritual ones to have a tender Ladies hand with a Lions-heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring a fallen Brother, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p>Fourthly, He ſtrengtheneth that which is ſick; turns Phyſician too as well as Chirurgion: gives ſomething inwardly to cure the Diſtempers that are within. Ah how ſick doth ſin make the Soul! Sin and Wrath, like a Diſeaſe and Phyſick in the Stomach, make ſad work, till it be vomited up. Chriſt hath both purging and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Phyſick for his: He works upon their corruptions to drive them out, by the bitter Aloes of affliction he kills the Worms, which ſweet meats have cauſed; he purgeth their filthineſs out, by giving them bitter things to drink, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. the taking away of noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours, is the ready way to add ſtrength to the body. It was <hi>good for</hi> David <hi>that he had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. it rid him of thoſe two evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, high-mindedneſs and earthly-mindedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. 1. And when he hath well cleanſed them, he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34195:42"/> gives dainty reſtoratives, whereby their ſtrength is renewed. He addeth ſtrength to his in their way, <hi>Job. 17. 9. Heb.</hi> ſhall add ſtrength, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall be fortified more and more; ſhall ſtrengthen himſelf more in his piety and good waies. When I am weak, then am I ſtrong, ſaid <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 10. ſtrongeſt through hope in Chriſt, when weakeſt through ſenſe in my ſelf, not only by an intrinſecal diſpoſition, that we are more inclined to ſeek help and ſtrength; but indeed by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual capacity, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is more ready to beſtow ſtrength, when we are ſenſible of our own weakneſs.</p>

                  <p>A Sheep (though by the Philoſopher called a fooliſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34195:44"/> and ſluggiſh Creature, the moſt ſtupid of four footed Creatures, apteſt of any thing to wander, though it feel no want, and unableſt to return) is not more apt to ſtray, than God's poor ones are to go aſtray, and to turn aſide from God, and run away from duty: It's one particular wherein the Analogie between Saints and Sheep conſiſts, that both are ſo apt to ſtray, and being once out, to go aſide more and more. Chriſts great care therefore towards his, is to fetch them in from their ſtray-going. 'Twas for this <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Pſal. 119. ult.</hi> though a ſheep ſtill, yet wander, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need ſeeking, <hi>q. d.</hi> I go aſtray, running hither and thither, like a ſilly Sheep to my own loſs, unleſs ſought and brought back by thee. Now Chriſt hath many waies by which, like a good Shepherd, he reduceth his ſtray-going Sheep.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometimes he calls them unto him, when they are turning aſide from him: he calleth his in the firſt converſion out of darkneſs into his marvellous light; from the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction, to the way of holineſs and peace: <hi>not to uncleanneſs, but to holineſs, 1 Theſ.</hi> 4. 7. and when they return to folly, after peace firſt ſpoken to them, his voice is heard to call them to return by repentance.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus <hi>Jer. 3. 1. yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Every ſin is a going away from God, and therefore is Repentance expreſt ſo often by a returning; and this upon Gods call, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6, 7. there is a natural <hi>Novatianiſm</hi> in the timorous conſciences of convinced ſinners, to doubt and queſtion pardon for ſins of Apoſtaſie and falling after repentance; Chriſt therefore calleth his hereto: come, return, turn even to the Lord, yea, he followeth after thoſe that run from him, as the Sun-beams do the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger that goeth from them; and as is ſweetly ſet out by our Lord in thoſe three parables of the loſt Groat,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34195:45"/> loſt Sheep, and loſt Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Contrition is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Rev</hi> 9. 20. converſion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from ſin, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. to this is Gods call; and this men do upon conſideration, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 59. ſee that call alſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 1. Sin is a turning the back upon God, <hi>i. e.</hi> a going away from the chief Good, who is not willing that his ſhould leave Him, and therefore calls upon them to return to Him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if Calls prevail not, he reproveth, chargeth their ſin upon them, and commandeth their returns; he doth not only adviſe to it by an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical counſel (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> diſtinguiſh) but requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it as their expected duty. How he rates his People many times to bring them to better carriage? Will you bring evil upon your ſelves by your Rebellion? Thus dealt he with <hi>David</hi> after his foul fall: no doubt but he had many a time heard Gods call to Repentance in his attendance upon the Law and Worſhip of God for thoſe Ten or Twelve Months, wherein he lay under his Sin without Repentance, but theſe prevailing little with him hereto, God ſends a particular charge againſt him by the Prophet, by a parable, and the plain expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and application of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1,-12. he tells him of what he had done for him, and chargeth on him what in return he had done againſt God, and threatens him for his unrighteous carriage, and all to break his heart, and bring him back from his evil waies; and he no ſooner comes in, but he is received; no ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, but hath a declaration of pardon. <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>God hath taken away thy Sin,</hi> ſaid the Prophet God deals plainly and openly with him, and the Prophet from God, <hi>thou art the man,</hi> and by ſuch checks, brings him home again to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>as the Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law a light, ſo ſuch reproofs or corrections are the way of Life.</hi> God chargeth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34195:45"/> it upon their Souls to return to him, if they intend to live.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when this alſo will not do, the Lord ſhakes his Rod, yea, and ſometimes laies it on too. By Rod, underſtand corrections, ſo termed in Scripture often: He often whips his in from their irregularities. And this ſometimes by giving them to meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſin; though they range thinking to meet with ſweeter food, yet they find not the ſweetneſs they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, yea, God croſſeth them in their evil courſes and this in kindneſs to bring them in.

Ah! this is a ſweet way of mercy, when God fetches in <hi>His</hi> from their purſuits of ſin, by their not over-taking their ſin. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he whips them for their ſin, and gives them to read their ſin in their puniſhment.

May not I bleſs my ſelf for all that men cry out againſt my covetouſneſs, my pride, my drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and uncleanneſs?

                  <p>Secondly, to clamour and noiſe; it is ſilent and makes no ſtir, doth not lay open its mouth.

                  <p>Secondly, Not clamorours, make no great noiſe of what they do, of what they ſuffer for Chriſt: Some ſuffer ſo grumblingly, with ſo much ſtirr, that it were better they bare nothing; every load on them makes them crack and complain ſo much: Saints are not ſo, they make not Mountains of Mole-hills; Yea, account the ſufferings of this preſent Life light, and not worthy to be brought into reckoning with the Glory reſerved for them. Hence it is not ſtrange to them though diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties do betide, yea, ſurround them, they expected no leſs: The firſt leſſon they learn in Chriſtianity is Chriſts Croſs; take him and his Croſs together, not accounting it as a ſtrange thing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. i. e. be not ſo afrighted, as they that fall upon ſome new thing, and which they never thought of before.

Whereas others in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings rave and rage againſt God. <hi>Cluverus</hi> (an Author of good credit) reports from eye-witneſſes this ſad ſtory.

                  <p>Thirdly, not offenſive or injurious to others, though they learn to ſuffer evil, yet not to do evil; no not to their Perſecutors, rendring evil for evil, nor reviling for reviling, but contrarywiſe bleſſing. The new nature hath armed them with defenſive, not with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive armour. Saints are not Bears, nor Lions, nor Bulls, but Sheep; who take much, do no wrong. They have taken out that leſſon from their Maſter, <hi>Mat. 5. 44. Love Enemies; bleſs, do good, pray for them.</hi> Thus Chriſt melted over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe of himſelf and his Saints.

Beaſts and Birds of prey, glut themſelves on theſe ſilly creatures. Waving Lions and Bears, unto which our Countries are ſtrangers, and of which we find what Enemies they are to Flocks; as may be ſeen in that one ſtory from <hi>David</hi> (to multiply no other quotations) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 34. where he ſpeaks not of one ſingular event, but of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that fell out often; which appears by the twofold manner of fight mentioned: Sometimes he followed

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34195:69"/> if he kills not, yet he frightens and ſcatters; which our Lord obſerves, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 12. when the Wolf comes to the Flock, he catches ſome which he kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and ſcatters others, driving them farr away for fear. Let me add one obſervation more of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture e're we leave him; he is obſerved to mix his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty with craft; <hi>(l)</hi> for ſome obſerve of him that when he goeth forth by night toward the Flock for prey, he comes towards them againſt the wind, leſt if he ſhould go with the wind, the Dogs ſhould get the ſcent of him, and ſo by their barking give notice of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Fox, which as he is known a crafty, ſo is ſound alſo an hurtful Creature to the Sheep, falling upon and killing them, eſpecially the younger, the little Lamb, ſucking their blood, with which he fills and gluts himſelf. Unto this cruelty as well as craft of this Creature doth Chriſt allude, where he calleth <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 31, 32. they tell him <hi>Herod</hi> would kill him, in which errand (as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks) haply he himſelf had ſent them to frighten him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, whom he feared to lay hands on, to put him to death: Chriſt knows both his ſubtilty and his cruelty, therefore fitly calls him Fox, <hi>Go tell that Fox.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Dog, though a tamed and houſhould Creature, yet will ſometimes turn not only a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter, but a Sheep-killer alſo; Ye ſhall have a Curr ſlily ſteal out ſometimes in a night, and fall upon and eat up a Sheep, and ſometimes more.

                  <p>Fourthly, Even the little Weeſel lies in wait for, and prevails to the murder of the poor weak Lamb; gets to the Throat, and there at a very ſmall orifice ſucks out its blood.</p>
                  <p>From above alſo, the Ravens, Crows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſit upon the Sheeps back, and pluck off the Wool from his ſides; but fall upon it, when weak eſpecially, and firſt endeavour to pick out its eyes; which alſo thoſe Creatures do by Lambs when firſt fallen.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtorms and winds too, are to the Sheep bitter Enemies, eſpecially the Hail and Snow, which force it to ſhelter, glad to get under the lee of an Hedge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ſometimes they are many of them overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Snow-drift, and buried under it. And many times whilſt the poor Creature runs to a buſh for ſhelter and defence, either it is entangled and kept hung by the brambles, or if it gets off, is ſure to leave ſome of its Fleece behind it. Thus is this harmleſs Creature lying open to many difficulties.</p>

The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of ſingular individual acts, but of the divers ſorts of ſins; and he ſpeaketh of thoſe that were ſanctified, at leaſt in his eſteem, and in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, and he puts himſelf into the number, though he were worthily called <hi>James</hi> the juſt.

                  <p>Firſt, How ſubject are Chriſtians to the rott of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which is a ſpreading, an infectious and a killing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe? It ſpreads over the whole man, and over the whole Congregation quickly. Hereſies ſpread like a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vim ſui veneni inter fidiles longiùs. diffundet, donec univerſum eccleſiae corpus contagio pervaſerit.</hi> Eſt.</note> 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 17. Diodate</hi> ſaith the learned call it <hi>Eſtiomene,</hi> which is ſo contagious that it ſuddenly ſpreads it ſelf into the next member, and ſo by degrees deſtroyes the whole body; ſo doth falſe Doctrine and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34195:76"/> Hereſie, being once admitted into the Soul, preſently overruns the parts, and takes the brain, and endangers the whole; and having poſſeſſed it ſelf of one of the members of a Church, will ſpread over all the body, if it be not withſtood in time. Errour is exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, and for the moſt part deadly, as the Leproſie in the Head was held to be. Jealouſie, Frenzie and Hereſie can hardly be cured, ſaith the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb. It is certain that errour is of an encroaching nature; let the Serpent but wind in his head, and he will quickly bring in his whole body. He that ſaith yea to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in a little, ſhall not ſay him nay when he pleaſeth; He that tumbleth down the Hill of Errours, will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave tumbling till he come to the bottom, and will endeavour to draw others with him. How ſoon were the <hi>Galatians</hi> unſettled by Seducers and Sect-maſters, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 6. What ill work made thoſe deceitful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s abſence? The Hereticks in the Primitive Churches, how ſpreading were they? <hi>The whole world wondred after the Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 13. 3. And of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>He was againſt all, and all againſt him, and the world groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wondring at it ſelf that it was wholly become</hi> Arrian. The catching nature of errour is wonderful, how men run from one Errour to another, and how this ſpark of fire kindles all that it comes near. How many in our daies having firſt ſuckt in <hi>Antinomian</hi> tenets, have thence become <hi>Socinians,</hi> then <hi>Anti-Trinitarians, Anti-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts,</hi> and at laſt ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>k <hi>Atheiſts?</hi> And how catching do we find it, through the righteous judgment of God, not ſtopping the malice of Satan which promotes mens corruptions to the carrying an end of errour? <hi>One wicked man ſpoileth much good,</hi> Eccleſs. 9. <hi>ult. he may be as an</hi> Achan <hi>in an army, as a</hi> Jonah <hi>in a Ship,</hi> a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-town, a common miſchief, a Traitor to the ſtate;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34195:76"/> eſpecially if he be an eminent man, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> filling <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with blood, and cauſing <hi>Judah</hi> alſo to ſin, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 11. and bringing on them that evil threatned, <hi>verſ. 12. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 6. ſpreading the infection of his wickedneſs, that is more catching than the Plague. Compared to leven in regard both of the Perſons ſelf, in that it doth more and more ſowre and pollute the Soul, till at laſt it hath left no place free, if ſeaſonable Repentance prevent it not; and in regard of the whole Congregation, in that it ſpreadeth further and further in the body of the Church, if timely and effectual oppoſition be not made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the rott of Hereſie, ſo the Scab of unrighteous practices, are Chriſtians much ſubject to, which alſo is of a ſpreading and a dangerous nature. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto may we apply that of <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 29. As errour, ſo unrighteouſneſs is catching; eſpecially if it be of any in ſome eminency. <hi>Peter</hi> cannot diſſemble alone, but carries away <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. 13. The ſins of Teachers, are the Teachers of ſins; the ſins of men in Authority ſeem to give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſin. Great mens ſins go as ſeldom unaccompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their perſons: Yea, ſuch mens example is a kind of compulſion, <hi>Why compelleſt thou,</hi> &amp;c? 'Twas of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> that the Apoſtle uſeth that Proverb, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. practical unrighteouſnneſs is apt to creep from one part to another: <hi>David</hi>'s ſloth to gazing, to luſting, to adultery in the act, to flattery, making <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> drunk, and ſtaid not till it came to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right murder. So <hi>Peter</hi>'s fear to denying his Maſter with curſing and ſwearing.</p>
                  <p>But, Thirdly, Above all, how apt are even Saints themſelves to be heated in their blood, and ſo lifted up,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34195:77"/> above themſelves with the feaver of pride? Ah! how apt are men to ſwell, and think highly of themſelves, even becauſe by Grace they have received more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Good food and good feeding makes much blood, and hence Feavers and Pleuriſies many times enſue. I knew a man whoſe many, and thoſe dangerous, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers Phyſicians ſaid were occaſioned <note n="*" place="bottom">This was according to the old notion, that the Liver is <hi>offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſanguinis.</hi>
                     </note> by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Liver, which did ſanguifie much, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free Eater, often fell into Feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pride, like the thiſtle, grows in the beſt Soil. Not only thoſe that knew not God, but ſuch alſo as he had done much for, too often forget him and themſelves too. <hi>Iſraels pride teſtified to his face, Hoſ.</hi> 5. 5. 'tis the great maſter-pock of the Soul. Though the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>knowledge puffeth up, 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 1. Yet, Pride uſually flows from ignorance.—<hi>They have not known the Lord, The Pride of Iſrael teſtifieth,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Laodiceans</hi> were therefore proud, becauſe ignorant, <hi>thou knoweſt not that thou art wretched,</hi> &amp;c ſo thoſe queſtion-ſick Phantaſticks were <hi>proud, knowing nothing, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 4. And the Apoſtle would have his <hi>Romans not be ignorant, leſt they ſhould be puffed up, Rom. 11. 25.

As there be white teeth in the blackeſt <hi>Blackmore,</hi> ſo there is a black bill in the whiteſt Swan; but <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Submiſſior factus eſt a ſuperbia cordis ſui.</hi> Vatabl.</note> pride humbled him the more, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. as God gives his People to be gainers by their ſins; whence that paradox of <hi>Auguſtin's, My ſins in ſome ſenſe do me more good than my graces; for they make me afterward more humble, careful, more thankful for a Saviour, more merciful to others, more deſirous of the ſtate of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:34195:77"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pride did early bud in the World. The firſt act of the firſt Creatures, Angels, of them that fell, was pride, ſay ſome. And there are that probably not unfitly think, that it had much influence on <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. 6. Even in Chriſts Family it too much prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat. 18. 1. Mar. 9. 34. Paul</hi> ſpeaks his own danger, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. That Revelations of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries ſhould be puffing up, is ſad; Yet, as <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> leſt he ſhould be lifted up with his many rare viſions, is frequently called Son of Man, to put him in mind of his mortality and miſerable condition; ſo had <hi>Paul</hi> a Thorn in the Fleſh, a corruption edged with ſome temptation, left he ſhould be exalted. If <hi>Paul</hi> had not been buffeted, who knows whither he would have ſwollen? He might have been carried higher in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, than before he had been in his extaſie. This Thorn in his Fleſh was a mean to let out the Impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated matter of pride out of his heart. And he that had found the evil of it in himſelf, forewarnes others of it, <hi>Rom. 12. 3. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17. not to think, not to conceit highly of themſelves. Even Church-Officers may be in danger hereof, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members too; to be proud of the gift of God, the Bleſſings of God, the helps afforded us by God, Health, Wealth, Credit, Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is bad; but O! to be proud of the Graces of God, how ſad?</p>
                  <p>And O! that, Fourthly, We could not ſay, that the Sheep of Chriſtare very ſubject to the Giddy, to turn round, to be unſettled, and unconſtant; But alas! ſad experience too much atteſts it. How Childiſh are many Profeſſours, <hi>ever learning, never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> It's much to be lamented that what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the effect of the Miniſtry, is no more evident in too many, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. The craft and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34195:78"/> cogging of men, how doth it carry too many about <hi>with every wind of Doctrine?</hi> Many mens heads are ſo big, that they are too heavy for their bodies: ſo much wind in them that it carries them about like wind-mills, which way ſoever the Wind ſits.

No wonder that the Ancients placed great part of their wealth in Sheep, ſeeing they are ſuch enriching Creatures. Whatſoever comes from them is ſome way or other uſeful. They have not only fleſh for food, and fleece for raiment; but for Phyſick alſo for man and beaſt, is it a very uſeful Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature. Some Creatures are uſeful only whilſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live as the Horſe, Dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which we have emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument only whilſt living; but being dead are only Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, offenſive, and therefore to be thrown out of ſight. Some Creatures are uſeful only when dead, whilſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live rather offenſive and hurtful, if not duly watched, and care taken of them; ſuch are Swine, whoſe grunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe and unſavoury ſmell trouble us; beſides the ſpoil they make where-ever they come, if great heed and care be not taken to them; Hence we ſay, Swine are never good till they are hung up by the heels. But now the Cow, the Bullock, and the Sheep eſpecially, are of great uſe both living and dead: The Cow for the pail, the Bullock for drought while alive, and when ſlaughtered for the trencher. The Sheep here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in excells, for the revenue ſhe yearly affords in fleece and lamb, it's hard if it defraies not the charge of it's keeping; its dung, ye know how it manures your Land; the little charge ye are at in improving your Lands by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny compoſt for tillage, where your Sheep have walked,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34195:80"/> eſpecially have lodged, is ſufficient evidence how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching they are to your Countrey. And whereas ye may obſerve how the Urine of Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Its Wool, its Lamb, its Pelt, its Fleſh, its Entrails, its very Excrements ſpeak it a very profitable Creature. And theſe things are better known, than that they ſhould be much ſpoken to.</p>

Thus was <hi>Laban</hi> from a little come to great wealth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 30. his ſtock was little when <hi>Jacob</hi> came, and now it was broken out, and encreaſed to a multitude. <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo from nothing but a ſtaff, in few years was owner of great Flocks, <hi>Gen. 30. ult.</hi> in ſo much, as that <hi>Labans</hi> Sons begrutched him his increaſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 1. <note n="s" place="bottom">

Three waies of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying have theſe Creatures above other uſeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching ſtock, which ſpeaks them fruitful, and thereby of great advantage.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They will receive the Ram whilſt young; by that time they are Twelve or Thirteen Months old, ye may ſee them with Lambs by their ſides. Though I know Sheep-Maſters with us endeavour carefully to prevent ſuch a thing, becauſe of the ſpoil of the breed, ſuch uſually being not ſo large, nor bringing forth their young ſo large and ſtrong, as thoſe that are kept from the Ram till elder, yet in the beginning of their breed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the war ceaſed, men were more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34195:88"/> of growing up in number, knowing that they could better their breed by culling, as they would. Whereas we ſee the Hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Sheep will frequently bring twins, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thereby grow and encreaſe much in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. This alſo I know is now againſt our Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, who ſay one good Lamb is better than two ſmall ones: yet, we ſometimes find an Ewe with a Lamb at each ſide, and they kindly and bravely thriving, and the Dam feeding them up well enough. And this in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> ſeems to be accounted a ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of which we read in <hi>Solomons</hi> Song once and again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 2. and 6. 6. <note n="t" place="bottom">

Though we have read of ſome that even then have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reproofs to good purpoſe. Mr. <hi>White</hi> reports of a Knight not many years ſince, playing at Tables, his Chaplain ſtanding by, the Knight being angry, ſwore, the Chaplain reproved him; the Knight ſwearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he reproved him again: whereupon the Knight in much anger turning towards him, ſaid, <hi>Who art thou that dareſt reprove me?</hi> The Chaplain anſwered, <hi>Nay, but who are thou that thou dareſt thus blaſpheme thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker?</hi> The Knight being convinced by this juſt reproof, retired into his Chamber, and gave his Chaplain Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pieces for his faithfulneſs to him. Reproofs alſo muſt be well temper'd, as well as ſeaſonable; done in meekneſs. Though ſometimes ſome warmth be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet ſhould it not be ſcalding, leſt perſons think it more out of wrath then kindneſs. Reproof is, though a wholeſome, yet a bitter Pill; there is need of gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſugaring it for the beſt. As <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> to <hi>Job, if we eſſay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?</hi> Some reproach rather than reprove, little hopes that that will do any good.

Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> ſpeaks of Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> an eminent Miniſter in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, being at a great feaſt,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34195:91"/> had a young Gallant that ſate over againſt him, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other vain diſcourſes brake out into ſwearing: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> gravely and ſharply reproved him; the Gallant being impatient of reproof, flung a glaſs of Beer into his Face: Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the abuſe, but wiped his Face, and fell to his meat as before, the young Gallant fell to his old diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and ſwo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I was thus and thus, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and I obtained mercy. Real Chriſtians would not eat their morſels alone, but participate unto others, what God hath freely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto them. This, no doubt was what <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> ſaith of <hi>Bilney,</hi> that he deſired him to hear his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it was not ſurely his barely repeating <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> &amp;c which <hi>Latimer</hi> knew well enough, but it was what he had found God doing to; and upon his heart; for of it <hi>Latimer</hi> acknowledges, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by learnt more than he had learnt in many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     </hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By their holy and ſhining converſations. There is much conviction in the regular life of thoſe that profeſſe God. Though men ſhould beware not to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34195:91"/> live holily, for this end that they may be ſeen of men; yet ſhould they take heed that men may ſee their good works, for this will engage them to glorifie their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. It's a vain thing to reprove others of what our ſelves are guilty; to ſhew others the danger of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while our ſelves venture on it. <hi>Quid verba audiam cùm videam facta?</hi> One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Miniſter to ſhew him a nearer way to Heaven than he preacht to them, for himſelf went not that way. But the holy lives of Gods ſervants have mighty force in them, either to convince, as were <hi>Nebuchadnezar, Darius, Diocleſian,</hi> &amp;c. or (which is better) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them that obſerve them. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of himſelf, that by beholding the Chriſtians piety in life, and patience in death, he gathered their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be the Truth, and glorified God in the day of his viſitation. Of one <hi>Cecilia</hi> a Virgin it is reported, that by her piety, conſtancy and exhortations before and after Martyrdom 400 were converted. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> calls good works unanſwerable ſyllogiſms, invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible demonſtrations to confute and convert <hi>Pagans.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> could not but acknowledge, that the Chriſtian Religion ſpread by the holineſs of the lives of thoſe that profeſſed it. <hi>Bede (Hiſt. Angl.</hi> l. 1. c. 7.) mentioneth one <hi>Albane,</hi> who receiving a poor perſecuted Chriſtian into his houſe, and ſeeing his holy and devout carriage, was ſo much affected therewith, that he became an earneſt Profeſſor of the Faith, and in the end a Glorious Martyr.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By their cheerful walking: There's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope to bring men off from their carnality, wherein they conſult their pleaſures, by ſhewing them the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities only of Religion; as if real Godlineſs were a meer marr-mirth, and had nothing pleaſant or ſweet in it. The probable and eaſie way to convince men, is to let
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34195:92"/> them ſee that Chriſtianity hath the moſt real ſweets; that <hi>joy in the Lord</hi> is worth that name indeed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all carnal and ſinful joy is but a meer mock and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of it; in the midſt of which the heart is ſad: whereas true Godlineſs rejoyceth in tribulation, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with troubles in the Fleſh. The three Worthies could walk in the midſt of the fiery furnace as in ſome pleaſant place, when the Son of God was with them. Any place is a Paradiſe where God is preſent. What therefore he ſaid flatteringly to his Friend, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 4. may be much more ſaid to thee, <hi>O Chriſtian, why art thou lean from day to day, ſeeing thou art the Kings Son?</hi> How often doth the Apoſtle preſs to ſpiritual joy, and that in all ſtates and conditions? Hardly any duty more preſt in Old and New Teſtament, or leſs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. Fitly is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. ſubjoyned to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. for as this ends, <hi>Be glad in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that begins, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Plato</hi> could tell the Muſicians, that Philoſophers knew how to be merry without Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: much more may Gods People. As a Traveller rides on merrily, and wears out the tediouſneſs of the way, by ſinging ſweet ſongs unto himſelf: ſo ſhould Saints, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 54.</p>
